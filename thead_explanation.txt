This code is for a multithreaded server in C. It uses the socket API and the pthread library to handle incoming connections from clients.

    The accept function is called to wait for incoming connections on a socket identified by the socket_desc descriptor. When a client connects, the accept function returns a new socket descriptor for communication with the client. The client structure is filled with the client's address information.

    For each new connection, a new thread is created using pthread_create. The thread function connection_handler is passed the new_sock parameter, which is a pointer to the newly created socket descriptor for communication with the client.

    The malloc function is used to allocate memory for the new_sock variable. This memory is then passed to the thread function as a parameter.

    The pthread_create function returns zero on success and a non-zero value on failure. If it fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

    The main thread continues to wait for new connections and repeat the process of creating a new thread for each connection.
